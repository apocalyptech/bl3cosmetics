This is a repo to hold galleries of all the cosmetic items available in
Borderlands 3, exported via Github Pages at: <https://apocalyptech.github.io/bl3cosmetics/>.

The gallery pages themselves are all generated with the `gen_site.py`
script.  That script requires [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/), and has only been tested on Python 3.9.

All code found in here is licensed under the [3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

The actual screenshots I lay no claim to -- I've got no idea how rights to
those are supposed to work.  From my perspective I'd be happy to put them under
public domain (or [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/))
but I'm not sure if they technically belong to Gearbox or something.
