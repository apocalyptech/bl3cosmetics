<h1>Original Imgur Galleries</h1>

<p>
These galleries used to be hosted at <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a>,
but I found that long-term management of periodically-updating image sets
like these was super annoying through imgur, so I moved them over here.
Those galleries are mostly current as of the August 5, 2021 patch, though
they're missing a set of unreleased character heads from that dataset.
I'll be leaving these older galleries as-is, but they won't see any
future updates (so they'll definitely be missing Vault Card 3 once that
drops, for instance).
