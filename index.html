<h1>Borderlands 3 Cosmetics Galleries</h1>

<p>
This is a collection of galleries which show off all available cosmetic
items for Borderlands 3, including ones which can't <i>officially</i>
be acquired in-game.  These should be complete as of the August 5, 2021
patch (which introduced Vault Card 2).
</p>

<p>
This site doesn't really intend to give much more information than just
the galleries themselves.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v-F_3C2ceaFKJae1b6wmbelw_jLjmPPriBLzGTZMqRc/edit?usp=sharing">This
Google Sheet</a> contains more information such as drop sources for
many of the cosmetics, which ones are locked to particular DLCs, and
"Balance" paths which can be used in conjunction with writing
<a href="https://borderlandsmodding.com/bl3-writing-mods/">hotfix mods</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to just unlock all cosmetics with an external utility, there's
a few utilities which will do it for you:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bl3.swiss.dev/">Raptor's Web-Based Editor</a> - Upload `profile.sav` directly there.  Sourcecode is <a href="https://github.com/cfi2017/bl3-save">also available</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3ProfileEditor/releases">FromDarkHell's Profile Editor</a> - Download and run locally</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3-cli-saveedit">apocalyptech's CLI editor</a> - Python-based and commandline, so probably not for many folks</li>
</ul>
