<h1>Borderlands 3 Cosmetics Galleries</h1>

<p>
This is a collection of galleries which show off all available cosmetic
items for Borderlands 3, including ones which can't <i>officially</i>
be acquired in-game.  These should be complete as of the August 5, 2021
patch (which introduced Vault Card 2).
</p>

<p>
This site doesn't really intend to give much more information than just
the galleries themselves.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v-F_3C2ceaFKJae1b6wmbelw_jLjmPPriBLzGTZMqRc/edit?usp=sharing">This
Google Sheet</a> contains more information such as drop sources for
many of the cosmetics, which ones are locked to particular DLCs, and
"Balance" paths which can be used in conjunction with writing
<a href="https://borderlandsmodding.com/bl3-writing-mods/">hotfix mods</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to just unlock all cosmetics with an external utility, there's
a few utilities which will do that for you.  Note that vehicle skins are
unlocked on a per-save basis, whereas all other cosemtics are stored in the
global <tt>profile.sav</tt> file.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bl3.swiss.dev/">Raptor's Web-Based Editor</a> - Upload directly there.  Sourcecode is <a href="https://github.com/cfi2017/bl3-save">also available</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3ProfileEditor/releases">FromDarkHell's Profile Editor</a> - Download and run locally (does not unlock vehicle customizations)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3-cli-saveedit">apocalyptech's CLI editor</a> - Python-based and commandline, so probably not for many folks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have any comments/questions about any of this, feel free to post in
<a href="https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/borderlands-3-cosmetics-galleries/4540285">this thread at the Gearbox forums</a>,
or <a href="https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3cosmetics">submit an Issue/PR on the github repo</a>.
Sourcecode for the site generation, and all the images themselves, are also
available in the github repo, so feel free to clone that and host it anywhere
else, if you like.  I make no claims to any of this.
