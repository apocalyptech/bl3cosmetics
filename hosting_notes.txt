These images were originally just hosted directly off of Imgur, but keeping
those up to date proved to be rather annoying.  In the end, none of the
other free image-gallery hosting sites really had a frontend which I liked,
though, which is how I ended up with this repo here.

Right now the repo just uses "local" github files to serve its images,
which I think should be okay given the traffic it looked like these
things were seeing.  In the event that it's more popular than I imagine it
to be, though, it's possible that we'll run afoul of Github's transfer
limits for Pages-hosted sites.

If that does happen, I do already have a system in place for it, and I may
even start pre-filling that out.  Basically each `Shot` object can be given
a URL to an image, and if `gen_site.py` is run with the `-u`/`--urls`
option, it'll make use of those URLs instead of the local files.  So,
upload the images elsewhere, create the mappings, regen the site, and Bjorn
Stroningthearm's your uncle.

My personal preference for what image-hosting site to use is, at time of
writing (early September, 2021), Dropbox, but there's a variety of sites
that would do.  Imgur itself doesn't work *terribly*, but if you try to
link directly to an image, you'll get directed into Imgur's framework at
least once, though subsequent loads of the same HREF will probably get you
to the image after that.

My preferred runner-up would be Google Photos, though I'm not keen to add
any more Google dependencies to anything of mine.  I suppose the full
preferred order would currently be something like:

1. Github (current)
2. Dropbox
3. Google Photos
4. imgbb

And then to the ones I'd actually *not* recommend at all, for various
reasons:

5. Flickr - backend is super annoying to work with
6. Wix - Their business model is very orthogonal to what I'd intend to
   do with it; I'd be reasonably worried that the account would get
   cancelled at some point
7. imgur - Can't directly link to the images without getting framework
   redirects
8. imgbox - Slow as hell

And, in conclusion, the pros/cons that I'd been jotting down while trying
all these:

0) Github
   Pros:
     * Generation code and images could live side-by-side
     * Fast
     * Easy cloning for anyone else wanting to take a backup of it
   Cons:
     * 100GB/month transfer limit.  Would definitely want to generate
       thumbnails for inlining

1) imgur
   Pros:
     * On-site gallery view is basically exactly what I want
     * Fast
     * Can seemingly be straight <img>-embedded without much trouble
   Cons:
     * Annoying as hell to work with
     * Reordering is painful
     * Can't be "properly" linked-to: HREF will load an imgur page
       and the user would have to click a second time to get fullscreen.

2) Google Photos
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
     * Image URLs can be customized to do serverside resizing
     * Backend management of files is nice and easy (folder-based)
   Cons:
     * Is Google
     * Images noticeably slow to load
     * On-site gallery view is lame

3) imgbb
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
     * Fast
   Cons:
     * On-site gallery view isn't really what I want, though it's not
       awful.

4) Wix
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
     * Fast
     * Backend management of files is nice and easy (folder-based)
   Cons:
     * No real builtin backend gallery stuff; it's more a generic website
       builder place.
     * Would be vaguely concerned that it'd get deleted due to inactivity,
       or taken down on account of being screenshots or something...
     * Terms + Conditions have stuff in there that'd be terrifying if I
       were an actual creator.
 
5) Flickr
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
     * Fast
   Cons:
     * On-site gallery view isn't really what I want
     * Management of galleries is pretty cumbersome and annoying
     * Finding static image URLs for embedding is annoying; have to go out
       to media info in the browser, to get it.

6) Imgbox
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
   Cons:
     * Backend is pretty lame
     * SLOW.  Worst of the bunch so far
     * On-site gallery isn't workable at all

7) Dropbox
   Pros:
     * Can be embedded and directly <img>-embedded without much trouble
     * Fast
     * Backend management is trivial
   Cons:
     * No on-site gallery functionality at all
