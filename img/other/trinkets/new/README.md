Some utilities to deal with new Trinket screenshots:

1. `extract.py` looks for screenshots in the current dir and clips out
   the regions where we'd find Trinket thumbnails.
2. `generate.sh` was used to combine all the individual thumbnail
   screenshots into combined gallery-style photos, from back when I was
   hosting these from imgur.  This one's not really used anymore, but
   I was keeping it here for reference.
3. The `edited` dir contains my image processing for the Pain Freeze
   trinket, whose thumbnail image has never worked right.  Just took
   a screenshot of the trinket in-game and worked up a thumbnail-like
   image in [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).
